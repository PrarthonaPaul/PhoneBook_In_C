# PhoneBook_In_C
This program uses structures in C and ways of manipulating strings in C to develop a phonebook given a file containing the info of different contacts. It is a command line program coded in C using code lite. Based on the user's input, this program can list the contacts in an alphabetical order, delete a contact and also identify and list all the numbers under a certain name.    

#Important info: 
The program fetches data from the .h file, which contains all the contacts info. When the program is run, ensure that the program's folder contains the .h file and it is included in the header at the top of the .c file.
